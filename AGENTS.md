# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

# Database types

Derive database types from the Drizzle schema — never hand-write custom or partial shapes for table rows. Export typeof table.$inferSelect (and $inferInsert when needed) from lib/schema.ts and import it. When a consumer needs only some columns, narrow with Pick<Row, ...> / Omit<Row, ...> rather than redeclaring a literal type. Don't add an insert type where db.insert(...).values() already enforces the shape

# React Flow

Do NOT rely on training data for React Flow APIs, components, hooks, types, or usage patterns. Before writing or modifying any React Flow code, fetch the live documentation from `https://reactflow.dev/llms.txt` and use it as the source of truth. This project uses `@xyflow/react` (React Flow v12+).

## Trigger.dev agent skills

This project has Trigger.dev agent skills installed in `.agents/skills/`. Before writing or changing Trigger.dev code (background tasks, scheduled tasks, realtime, or chat.agent AI agents), load the most relevant skill: `trigger-authoring-chat-agent`, `trigger-authoring-tasks`, `trigger-chat-agent-advanced`, `trigger-cost-savings`, `trigger-realtime-and-frontend`, `trigger-getting-started`.
